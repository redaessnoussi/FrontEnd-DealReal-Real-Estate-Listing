## Getting Started

To get started with the Deal Real app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/redaessnoussi/FrontEnd-DealReal-Real-Estate-Listing.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file and filling in the required values. Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required variables.
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

## Development Server

To run the development server, use the following command:

````bash
## Would you like to see the project live? => [Visit Now](https://deal-real-real-estate-listing.vercel.app)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More
